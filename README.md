# DotSAN (Dataset of the Argentine Society for Neuroscience)

DotSAN is a project to map the names of all Argentinian neuroscientists and link them with various public data sources to create a comprehensive picture of the Argentinian neuroscience research landscape that may serve multiple purposes including, but not limited to, evidence-based policy and institutional decisions as well as scientific production upon the structure and dynamics of such community. 

Given the fact that there isn't a clear-cut category within the Argentine scientific system to distinguish neuroscientists and given the particular nature of the discipline (such as the strong interdisciplinarity) we believe it is important to come up with adequate data to characterize this community. 

## What does the repository contain?




## General Use

If you just want the extracted and curated data to use right away, then there are two main ways to proceed. 

The easisest way is to clone the current repository into your local machine by executing the following command   
`git clone https://github.com/Aler-u/DotSAN`  
From there you get all the files included in the repository so you can use whatever file you need. 

The second way is to download a .zip file containing all the files directly from this github repository and then proceed the same as before. 

A third way, albeit more complicated, is to navigate inside the repository towards the .csv file you want, open it and click the _Raw_ option which will open a new tab from where you now can save the page as a plain text file.
