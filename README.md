# DotSAN (Dataset of the Argentine Society for Neuroscience)

----

DotSAN is a project to map the names of all Argentinian neuroscientists and link them with various public data sources to create a comprehensive picture of the Argentinian neuroscience research landscape that may serve multiple purposes including, but not limited to, evidence-based policy and institutional decisions as well as scientific production upon the structure and dynamics of such community. 

Given the fact that there isn't a clear cut category within the Argentine scientific system to distinguish neuroscientists and given the particular nature of the discipline (such as the strong interdisciplinarity) we believe it is important to come up with adequate data to caracterize this community.
